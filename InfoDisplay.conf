# only start this service after the httpd user process has started
#start on syno.network.ready
start on runlevel 2

# stop the service gracefully if the runlevel changes to 'reboot'
stop on runlevel [06]

# run the scripts as the 'admin' user. Running as root (the default) is a bad idea.
setuid admin

# exec the process. Use fully formed path names so that there is no reliance on $PATH
# the 'www' file is a node.js script which starts the foobar application.
